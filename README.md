Disease Prediction Model Evaluation
In our project, we have implemented several prediction models to accurately predict diseases based on blood samples. After thorough evaluation and comparison, we have determined that the XGBoost classifier outperforms other models with an accuracy of approximately 98%.
 Prediction Models Evaluated
1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN): A deep learning model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
2. XGBoost: An optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed for efficient and accurate large-scale machine learning.
3. Decision Tree Classifier: A model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
4. Logistic Regression: A statistical model that predicts the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.
